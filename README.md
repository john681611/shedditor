> Finally an editor more awkward than vim\s

A relatively simple editor for hammering sh*t out.

Written with [electon-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) and [vuetifyjs](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/). That is being developed for fun.

## Features:
* [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
* File Browser
* Saved state
* Sarky home page
* Dark and brooding theme.
